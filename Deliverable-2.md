# Deliverable 2 - **Transactional Service Methods**

This deliverable requires that you create working solutions for your transactional service methods using Linqpad. Complete the implementation of your scenario/subsystem service method(s). Test the service method(s). Your service method(s) are to be coded in separate Linqpad Program environment file(s), one for each scenario. 

> ***NOTE:*** Compiler errors that prevent the project from loading may be treated as an automatic mark of zero for this section.

Be sure to develop your solution in small increments, making frequent commits and referencing your issue numbers from GitHub.

Document any and all bugs in an issue attached to the appropriate milestone for your scenario.

Your Linqpad solution should:

1. contain user friendly error handling 
1. a query(ies) displaying the data manipulated by the service method transaction
1. use of the data models from your Deliverable-1 Planning Docment
1. Main method used as the driver for testing
1. services in their own appropriate method

**Use your class demonstrations in accomplishing this task.** You may discover issues with your original Planning document. **DO NOT** alter your original comments of your plan. Create **new** comments within your Planning document issue to track any changes to your original plan.
